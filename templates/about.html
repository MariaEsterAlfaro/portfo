                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>I graduated in May 2022 and I will conclude my master's degree in November 2022, in Materials
                    Engineering (UFSC), with a research focused on characterization of
                    3D-printed structures for tissue engineering. During my academic career, I took 4
                    internships in laboratories and 2 internships in industry, in varied areas.</p>
                  <p>In late 2021, I decided I would try to migrate from the academic field to the programming area,
                    so I started to study Python and to put into practice some knowledge to build graphs, based on data
                    of analyses performed for my graduate thesis and my master's dissertation.
                  <p>During 2022, I started to conciliate my postgraduate activities with an online Python course, which
                    allowed me to improve and increase my knowledge, and, based on some acquired concepts in HTML,
                    CSS and Javascript, I was able to host and edit this site, linking some coding projects I developed
                    during and after the course.
                  <h3>Motivation</h3>
                  <p>
                    I currently intend to change my career area due to the increasing demand and the many opportunities
                    in technology and programming (especially in Florianópolis, where I live), in addition to the good
                    valorization of professionals in this area - with great growth perspectives for who seeks to
                    constantly improve their skills.
                  <p>These are some of the advantages I see in comparison to working as an engineer,
                    which nowadays has been facing considerable difficulties, whether in the academic or the
                    industry field (whose main opportunities also tend to be in other regions).</p>
                  <h3>Perspectives</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am looking for an opportunity to start my career in the programming area, so it will allow me to
                    direct and improve my learning, seeking to become a more qualified professional. I have always
                    enjoyed studying and dedicating myself to activities that were proposed to me in the different
                    areas I worked, aiming to fulfill my tasks and show good performance.
                  <p>I still have a lot to learn and I intend to maintain the discipline and persistence I
                    have always had to develop myself and generate results when new projects come up for me.</p>
